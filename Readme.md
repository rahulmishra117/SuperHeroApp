# SUPERHERO API :- https://superheroapi.com/?ref=apilist.fun

## Features
1:- Search any superhero from the API and display the search results on the frontend (as I type the search results should update, just like Google does for suggestions).
Each search result of the superhero should have a favourite button, clicking on which the superhero should be added to “My favourite superheroes” (a list).
On clicking any particular search result (any superhero), open a new page with more information about that superhero (Superhero page).

2:-Superhero Page Should show a lot of information about the superhero like their name, photo, powerstats, bio (these are must, rest you can add if you want).

3:- My favourite superheroes Page
Display a list of all the favourite superheroes.
Make this list persistent (should have the same number of superheroes before and after closing the browser).
Remove from favourites button: Each superhero should have remove from favourites button, clicking on which should remove that superhero from the list.
